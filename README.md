## Structure

    each time a bot connects on the VM a new log file opens with the format
    shell.log_time. this is done in case multiple bots are connecting to it.

## Content of the logs
    Each action done by the bot is logged alongside the date and time of each
    action. This is done in order to study the actions of the bots.
